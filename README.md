## Project Description

The Regina Mandolin Orchestra (RMO) would like an improvement to their current website (mandolin.ca). The goal of this project is to provide the users with an updated build of their website, to provide a significantly enhanced user experience.

Some of the issues with the original site include: 
- Disorganized Archives 
- Convoluted 
- Difficult to navigate 
- Provides little means of communication 
  
The goal is to create an unobtrusive user experience that provides ease of website navigation that will: 
- Organize the previous site’s Archives 
- Utilize a simplistic user interface 
- Provide a means of Communication 
- Declutter unnecessary information 
  
Three major areas of concern: 
- Archives 
- Music Distribution 
- Members’ only site access
